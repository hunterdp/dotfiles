# My Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for various applications.

## What are dotfiles?

Dotfiles are configuration files for various programs on Unix-like systems. They are called "dotfiles" because their filenames usually start with a dot (`.`), which makes them hidden from normal directory listings.
